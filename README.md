# GitPolicyEnforcer

This is a command line utility written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
that helps you utilize Git hooks,
to enforce various policies.

It currently supports only the `update` server side Git hook. The goal is to include client side hooks too.

The tool has been developed so far for usage with self-hosted GitLab CE instances, due to internal needs. It should also work though, for bare git servers (maybe with some minor changes).

This is work in progress. You are welcome to contribute if this project is useful to you.

## Usage
For now, please check the following video:

According to time availability, more documentation will be added, and further development will happen.
